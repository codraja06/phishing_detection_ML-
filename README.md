This project implements a web-based tool for real-time phishing detection using a machine learning model integrated via the Flask framework. Users can input a URL and instantly receive a prediction on whether the link is legitimate or a potential phishing attempt, making machine learning accessible for practical cybersecurity awareness.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Phishing URL Detection:** Uses a pre-trained scikit-learn model to classify URLs as Legitimate or Phishing.
* **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Clean, responsive HTML/CSS interface for both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Result Display:** Result message (Legitimate/Suspicious) appears **only after input submission**, hidden by default.
* **Enhanced Styling:** Result box styled with color-coded feedback (green for legitimate, red for suspicious) and smooth fade-in animation.
* **Seamless Model Integration:** Production-ready approach to serve a machine learning model (.pkl file) via Python backend.
* **Real-Time Prediction:** Provides instantaneous feedback on URL submissions.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all devices, from mobile to desktop.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-detection-ml.git
cd phishing-detection-ml
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# On Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure the model is present:

* Verify that `phishing.pkl` is inside the `model/` directory.

### Running the Application

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the application in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

### 👩‍💻 Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Enter any website URL in the input field.
3. Click **Submit**.
4. View the prediction result (Legitimate or Suspicious) displayed dynamically.

## 🧠 Model Details

The application uses a trained machine learning model (`phishing.pkl`) built on a dataset of labeled phishing and legitimate URLs.

Typical features extracted for prediction include:

* URL length
* Number of subdomains
* Presence of `@`, `-`, or multiple `//`
* Presence of words like `login`, `secure`, or numeric patterns
* Whether `https` is used

> Note: `phishing.pkl` contains both feature extraction and the trained classifier (e.g., Random Forest).

## 🔧 Recent Updates

* ✅ Fixed issue where result text displayed even before input.
* ✅ Added conditional rendering logic in `index.html`.
* ✅ Enhanced CSS with animations, color-coded feedback, and better visibility control.
* ✅ Updated Flask route logic for cleaner predictions.
